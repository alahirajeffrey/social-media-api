- Learning how to use Docker and Docker compose
- Learning how to use Prisma ORM 
- Learning to setup swagger with express and typescript

## Requirements
- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. 
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) Prisma is a server-side library that helps developers read and write data to the database in an intuitive, efficient and safe way. It is easy to integrate into your framework of choice, Prisma simplifies database access, saves repetitive CRUD boilerplate and increases type safety. Its the perfect companion for building production-grade, robust and scalable web applications
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)  is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
